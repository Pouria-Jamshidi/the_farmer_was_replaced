# The_Farmer_Was_Replaced 

[The Farmer Was Replaced](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The_Farmer_Was_Replaced/) is a program/game in steam that operates in an original language similar to Python to operate agricultural drones and automate farms. Playing this game will improve problem-solving skills and coding abilities through programming.

## my scripts in this respitory

- this is not the most expert or tick efficent structure in game, simply my current state in game 
	- i have yet to finish this game so you might not find all the files you desire in this respitory , it is still being updated as i progress more and more in game and optimize my codes and add new codes to the respitory
    - i have yet to unlock more drones so currently all the codes here are made for a single drone only.

- short description of current .py files:
    
    - [movements.py](https://github.com/Pouria-Jamshidi/the_farmer_was_replaced/blob/main/movements.py) files contains function needed for efficient movements.
    - [neededFunctions.py](https://github.com/Pouria-Jamshidi/the_farmer_was_replaced/blob/main/neededFuctions.py) containts all general functions needed for farm to import and use.
    - [AfterExpansion.py](https://github.com/Pouria-Jamshidi/the_farmer_was_replaced/blob/main/AfterExpansion.py) file exist to get the farm ready again after you load the save or expand the farm as it will reset farm layout.
    - [startFarming.py](https://github.com/Pouria-Jamshidi/the_farmer_was_replaced/blob/main/startFarming.py) exists so you can start farming after running the AfterExpansion.py.
    - [Cactus_sort.py](https://github.com/Pouria-Jamshidi/the_farmer_was_replaced/blob/main/Cactus_sort.py) file contains all the functions needed for filling your farm with cactus to sort and harvest them.
        - currently only contains bobble sort and cocktail shake sort based algorithms.
    - [maze.py](https://github.com/Pouria-Jamshidi/the_farmer_was_replaced/blob/main/maze.py) just starts a maze so far. i have yet to structure any methods needed for solving the maze.
   

## How to Use

1. Browse the repository online on GitHub or clone/download it.
2. you can just directly copy the .py files and paste them in your game save files where your .py files exist. this respitory containts the files in my Save0 game folder so replacing or pasting them in your own game should not be complicated.
