## my scripts in this respitory

- this is not the most expert or tick efficent structure in game, simply my corrent state in game 
	- i have yet to finish this game so you might not find all the files you desire in this respitory , it is still being updated as i progress more and more in game and optimize my codes and add new codes to te respitory

- short description of current .py files:
    
    - movements.py files contains function needed for efficient movements.
    - neededFunctions.py containts all general functions needed for farm to import and use.
    - AfterExpansion.py file exist to get the farm ready again after you load the save or expand the farm as it will reset farm layout.
    - startFarming.py exists so you can start farming after running the AfterExpansion.py.
    - Cactus_sort.py file contains all the functions needed for filling your farm with cactus to sort and harvest them.
        - currently only contains bobble sort and cocktail shake sort based algorithms.
    - maze.py just starts a maze so far. i have yet to structure any methods needed for solving the maze.
    - debugging.py is nothing important. It's sole purpose is for me to type and try the codes i wrote in game or get print or quick_print with it
